# Deciphering the Digital Pulse: Interpreting the Impact of Social Media Sentiment on 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Outcomes

## Overview
This project explores the impact of Twitter sentiment and socio-demographic factors on the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election outcomes, employing spatial econometric models. The research interprets state-wise electoral behaviors focusing on major candidates, with a novel integration of social media dynamics.

## Contents
- `Python Scripts`: Contains the scripts used for gathering and analyzing Twitter sentiment.
- `GeoDa Files`: Includes spatial analysis files that detail the socio-demographic data and spatial statistics.
- `Research Paper`: A comprehensive document describing the methodology, data collection, analysis, and conclusions of the study.

- **Abstract**: The study examines the influence of social media alongside traditional socio-demographic and economic factors on the state-wise election outcomes, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes the `US Election 2020 Tweets` dataset from Kaggle and socio-demographic data from U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Labor.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Performed using the `Twitter-roBERTa-base for Sentiment Analysis` model, focusing on the sentiment expressed towards Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Conducted using GeoDa to analyze spatial distributions and autocorrelations in voter sentiment and behavior.

## Key Findings
- The correlation between Twitter sentiment and voting behavior is complex, indicating that while social media sentiment provides an interesting dimension, it does not directly translate to voting patterns.
- Socio-demographic and COVID-19 variables played significant roles in influencing voter preferences, reflecting in both spatial and non-spatial analysis models.

## How to Use This Repository
- **Python Scripts**: Run these scripts to replicate the sentiment analysis process.
- **GeoDa Analysis**: Open the included files with GeoDa software to explore the spatial statistical analyses performed.

## Concluding Remarks
This research underscores the multifaceted nature of electoral dynamics, where traditional factors and new-age digital platforms intersect, shaping the political landscape of modern elections.
