# Deciphering the Digital Pulse: Interpreting the Impact of Social Media Sentiment on 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Outcomes

## Overview
This project explores the impact of Twitter sentiment and socio-demographic factors on the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election outcomes, employing spatial econometric models. The analysis notably integrates social media dynamics with traditional electoral factors and emphasizes the significant role of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically examining how death rates influenced voting behaviors.

## Contents
- `Python Scripts`: Contains the scripts used for gathering and analyzing Twitter sentiment.
- `GeoDa Files`: Includes spatial analysis files that detail the socio-demographic data and spatial statistics.
- `Project Documentation`: A comprehensive document describing the methodology, data collection, analysis, and conclusions of the project.

## Abstract
The project examines the influence of social media alongside traditional socio-demographic and economic factors on the state-wise election outcomes. It distinctly emphasizes the role of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly investigating how death rates across states impacted voting behaviors, amidst other factors.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes the `US Election 2020 Tweets` dataset from Kaggle and socio-demographic data from U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Labor.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Performed using the `Twitter-roBERTa-base for Sentiment Analysis` model, focusing on the sentiment expressed towards Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Conducted using GeoDa to analyze spatial distributions and autocorrelations in voter sentiment and behavior, with a specific focus on the impact of COVID-19 death rates on electoral outcomes.

## Key Findings
- The correlation between Twitter sentiment and voting behavior is complex, indicating that while social media sentiment provides an interesting dimension, it does not directly translate to voting patterns.
- Socio-demographic factors and the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly death rates, played significant roles in influencing voter preferences, reflected in both spatial and non-spatial analysis models.

## How to Use This Repository
- **Python Scripts**: Run these scripts to replicate the sentiment analysis process.
- **GeoDa Analysis**: Open the included files with GeoDa software to explore the spatial statistical analyses performed, especially those relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Concluding Remarks
This project underscores the multifaceted nature of electoral dynamics, where traditional factors, new-age digital platforms, and significant public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic intersect, shaping the political landscape of modern elections.
